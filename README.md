## Features

- üìà **Candlestick Charts**: Visualizes annual temperature trends using Unicode-based candlestick plots.
- üîç **Filtering**: View temperature trends for a specific year range and country.
- üß† **Prediction**: Uses linear regression to forecast future temperatures.
- üåç **Country-Specific Analysis**: Reads temperature data for a given country code from a CSV file.

## Technologies

- **Language:** C++
- **Standard:** C++17
- **I/O:** Terminal-based interaction
- **Dependencies:** None outside of the standard library

## How to Use

### 1. Compile

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp Candlestick.cpp CSVReader.cpp Plotter.cpp Predictor.cpp WeatherData.cpp -o candlesticks
```

### 2. Run

```bash
./candlesticks
```

### 3. Example Flow

- Enter a country code (e.g., `GR`, `ES`, `FR`)
- Enter a start and end year (range: 1980‚Äì2019)
- View the generated candlestick chart and 5-year temperature prediction

## Requirements

- A valid CSV file named `weather_data.csv` in the same directory.
- The CSV should include a header with temperature columns like `GR_temperature`, `ES_temperature`, etc.
